        JobForAll was founded in 2015 by a team of seasoned recruiters and tech
        enthusiasts. Frustrated by the complexity of existing job boards, we set
        out to create a platform that prioritizes user experience, transparency,
        and efficiency. Over the years, we have helped thousands of
        professionals find their ideal jobs, from entry-level positions to
        executive roles.
